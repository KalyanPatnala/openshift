<strong>The Matrix is a system, Neo. 
  <br> 
That system is our enemy.
      But when youâ€™re inside, you look around, what do you see?
      Businessmen, teachers, lawyers, carpenters.
      <br> The very minds of the people we are trying to save.
      <br>But until we do, these people are still a part of that system and that makes them our enemy.
      <br>You have to understand, most of these people are not ready to be unplugged.
      And many of them are so inert, so hopelessly dependent on the system, that they will fight to protect it.
      
<br>      If you are not one of us, you are one of them.</strong>
